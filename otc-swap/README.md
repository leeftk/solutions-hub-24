## Key Design Decisions in OTCSwap Contract:

1. Atomic Execution:
   • Executes both token transfers in a single transaction
   • Ensures swap integrity - both transfers succeed or both fail

2. Flexible Token Pairing:
   • Allows swaps between any two ERC20 tokens
   • Enhances versatility by not restricting to specific token pairs

3. No Direct Ether Handling:
   • Focuses solely on ERC20 token swaps
   • Avoids complexities associated with direct Ether transfers

4. Permissionless Design:
   • Anyone can create a swap, promoting open usage
   • Counterparty specified at creation for targeted swaps

5. Time-Bound Swaps:
   • Implements expiration time for swaps
   • Prevents long-term open swaps, mitigating risks from market changes

These design choices create a secure, atomic OTC swap mechanism for ERC20 tokens. The atomic execution ensures that only the specified receiver can execute the swap. Using safeTransfer instead of transfer will account for tokens that don't have a return value or return false on failure instead of reverting such as USDT. The check and effects interaction pattern mitigates against potential reentrancy issues if using tokens with callback functions. Overall the contract is simple, straightforward, gas efficient and secure.
